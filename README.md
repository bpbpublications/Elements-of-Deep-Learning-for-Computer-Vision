# Elements of Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Explore Deep Neural Network Architectures, PyTorch, Object Detection Algorithms, and Computer Vision Applications for Python Coders

This is the repository for [Elements of Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/elements-of-deep-learning-for-computer-vision?_pos=1&_sid=f0c4fd485&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
Elements of Deep Learning for Computer Vision gives a thorough understanding of deep learning and provides highly accurate computer vision solutions while using libraries like PyTorch.

This book introduces you to Deep Learning and explains all the concepts required to understand the basic working, development, and tuning of a neural network using Pytorch. The book then addresses the field of computer vision using two libraries, including the Python wrapper/version of OpenCV and PIL. After establishing and understanding both the primary concepts, the book addresses them together by explaining Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). CNNs are further elaborated using top industry standards and research to explain how they provide complicated Object Detection in images and videos, while also explaining their evaluation. Towards the end,  the book explains how to develop a fully functional object detection model, including its deployment over APIs.

By the end of this book, you are well-equipped with the role of deep learning in the field of computer vision along with a guided process to design deep learning solutions.
